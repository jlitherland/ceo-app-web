# Security Policy

## Security Features

CEO App Web implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities:

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE**: Secure authentication flow via Supabase
- **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived access tokens with automatic refresh
- **Secure Cookies**: HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level authorization via Supabase

### 2. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: All API routes protected against abuse
  - Contract Analysis: 10 requests/hour per IP
  - General API: 100 requests/minute per IP
  - Auth endpoints: 5 requests/15 minutes per IP
  - Luminate proxy: 60 requests/minute per IP
- **API Key Protection**: All sensitive keys server-side only
- **Request Validation**: Input validation with Zod schemas
- **CORS Protection**: Configured via Next.js middleware

### 3. Content Security
- **Input Sanitization**: DOMPurify for all user-generated content
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers
- **XSS Protection**: Multiple layers of XSS prevention
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js CSRF protection

### 4. Security Headers
All responses include comprehensive security headers:
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Force HTTPS
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevent clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevent MIME sniffing
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Browser XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy`: Control referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy`: Restrict browser features
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Control resource loading

### 5. Error Monitoring
- **Sentry Integration**: Real-time error tracking
- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Automatic removal of auth tokens, cookies, and env vars
- **Production-Only**: Monitoring disabled in development

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env.local` files
   - Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for truly public values
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Dependencies**
   - Run `npm audit` before deploying
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review dependency changes in PRs

3. **Code Review**
   - All API routes must be reviewed for security
   - Check for SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities
   - Validate all user inputs

4. **Testing**
   - Write security tests for authentication flows
   - Test rate limiting effectiveness
   - Verify input sanitization

### For Users

1. **Account Security**
   - Use OAuth (Google/Apple) for secure authentication
   - Sign out from shared devices
   - Report suspicious activity immediately

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Review contracts before uploading
   - Don't share account credentials
   - Use strong, unique passwords for OAuth providers
